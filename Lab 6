Exercise 01:

01)
public interface MyFirstInterface {
    int x = 10;

    void display();
}
* There is no difference between declare the variable(x) with or without public static final keywords.Because in java interfaces,all variables are public,static and final.

02)
public interface MyFirstInterface {
    void display();
}
public interface MyFirstInterface {
    abstract void display();
}
* There is no difference between the abstract method with or without abstract keyword.Because in an interface, all methods are abstract.

03)
public class InterfaceImplemented implements MyFirstInterface {

    @Override
    public void display() {
        x = 20; // Trying to change the value of x
        System.out.println("Value of x inside the implemented method: " + x);
    }
}
*  Once a value is assigned to x, it cannot be modified in the implementing class. 
correct code:
public class InterfaceImplemented implements MyFirstInterface {
    private int customX = 20;

    @Override
    public void display() {
        System.out.println("Value of customX inside the implemented method: " + customX);
    }
}
